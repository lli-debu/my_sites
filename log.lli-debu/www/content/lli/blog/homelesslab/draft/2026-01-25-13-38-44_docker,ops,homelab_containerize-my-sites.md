Spent my Saturday night containerized my websites. Previousely they are running directly on Garlic (my ZimaBoard). Not only the manual setup is tediouse, but this is also less secure since if the sites are hacked the attacker can easily access everything on Garlic and my LAN - tho I doubt if anyone will target a small potato like me.
